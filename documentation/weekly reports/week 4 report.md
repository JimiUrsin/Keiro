# Week 4

Hours spent this week: 40
Hours spent total: 60

### What have you done this week?
Added visualizations and JPS (not really)

### How has the project progressed?
I thought I actually had JPS in the bag when it worked for smaller maps and some bigger ones but it's making pretty big detours when trying to find the goal on larger maps with a lot of obstacles. If I just managed to make JPS work this project could actually be going well...

### What did you learn this week?
How Java UI development works nowadays (last worked on them about 10 years ago). JPS. Despair

### What has been unclear?
What on earth is wrong with my JPS implementation, I've spent literally tens of hours on debugging it and I have no clue what could be wrong. I'm completely at my wit's end. Didn't ever imagine it would be this painful. From what I gather I'm probably just missing some fundamental part of the program but it's kind of impossible to know what it is because there is so little information on JPS online. I haven't found a single complete pseudocode or rundown on how each part of it is supposed to work. Is it possible to switch to another algorithm at this point or am I just doomed?

### What next?
Code polishing and UX improvement, getting JPS to actually work (not sure if I'm able to).
