# Week 5

Hours spent this week: 15
Hours spent total: 75

### What have you done this week?
Made JPS actually work and improved its visualization, and cleaned up the code

### How has the project progressed?
Now that JPS is actually working, the project is in very good shape.

### What did you learn this week?
The complete implementation of JPS from start to finish.

### What has been unclear?
I don't have to implement my own data structures since I'm doing a comparison with JPS and A\*, right?

### What next?
Making the UX better, and if I feel like it, implement IDA\*. 

Performance benchmarks: The visualizations of finding the best path also work as a rough performance benchmark but I'll probably try to make actual performance benchmarks in the coming week.
