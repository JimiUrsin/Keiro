### How to use the application
- Download some maps you want to try out (as a PNG) from the [Moving AI Lab](https://www.movingai.com/benchmarks/grids.html)
- Make sure you have Java 16
- Run the jar from the [latest release](https://github.com/JimiUrsin/Keiro/releases/latest)
- It will prompt you for a PNG file, select one of the maps you downloaded
- Click once to set your starting point on some open spot, you should hear a sound
- Click again to set your goal
- Click once more to start running Jump Point Search
- When that's done, click once more and it will run the A\* algorithm
- The program is done, if you want to try another map then close and rerun the program 

You can also create your own maps if you want to. Just create a PNG file with white or black pixels. White pixels will be open and black pixels are obstacles.
