# Keiro
A program for comparing pathfinding algorithms with visualizations.
### Quick guide
- Download some maps you want to try out (as a PNG) from the [Moving AI Lab](https://www.movingai.com/benchmarks/grids.html)
- Make sure you have Java 16
- Run the jar from the latest release, if it doesn't run by double clicking then try `java -jar Keiro-0.1.jar` in the folder where you downloaded it
- It will prompt you for a PNG file, select one of the maps you downloaded
- Click once to set your starting point on some open spot, you should hear a sound
- Click again to set your goal
- Click once more to start running Jump Point Search
- When that's done, click once more and it will run the A\* algorithm
- The program is done, if you want to try another map then close and rerun the program
